Debug with gdb
****************************

Host side gdb
======================
You can debug your host side OpenCL application with gdb the same way as
you debug other host side applications.  You will need to use flag "-g" 
during compilation.  You can refer to `gdb documentation`_ for details.

If gdb does not come pre-installed on your host file system, you will need
to download a package and install it, or you will need to download `gdb
release`_, build and install on your file system.

DSP side debug with host side client gdbc6x
===========================================
DSP side kernel code can be debugged with hosted debugger, gdbc6x.  The
process to debug kernel code in an OpenCL application is as follows.  You will
need two windows/consoles, one window to run OpenCL application, the other
to debug DSP side kernel.

1. In window 1, set environment variable ``TI_OCL_DEBUG`` before running
   application, for example, ``TI_OCL_DEBUG=gdb ./your_ocl_app`` if you use bash
2. Once the application is running, before launching your kernel to DSP,
   OpenCL runtime will print out a gdbc6x command in window 1, for example,
   gdbc6x -q -iex "target remote /dev/gdbtty0" -iex "set confirm off" -iex "symbol-file /usr/share/ti/opencl/dsp.out" -iex "add-symbol-file /tmp/opencl7mNBld.out 0x86000000" -iex "b exit" -iex "b VectorAdd"
3. Copy and paste the gdbc6x command into window 2, run it
4. Hit any key in window 1
5. Start debugging the kernel in window 2

The following are the sample output of window 1:

.. code-block:: bash

    root@am57xx-evm:~/oclexamples/vecadd# TI_OCL_DEBUG=gdb ./vecadd
    DEVICE: TI Multicore C66 DSP
    
    Offloading vector addition of 8192K elements...
    
    gdbc6x -q -iex "target remote /dev/gdbtty0" -iex "set confirm off" -iex "symbol-file /usr/share/ti/opencl/dsp.out" -iex "add-symbol-file /tmp/openclXmObdu.out 0x86000000" -iex "b exit" -iex "b VectorAdd" 
    Press any key, then enter to continue
    c
    Kernel Exec : Queue  to Submit: 4 us
    Kernel Exec : Submit to Start : 45 us
    Kernel Exec : Start  to End   : 83717229 us
    
    Success!

and window 2:

.. code-block:: bash

    root@am57xx-evm:~# gdbc6x -q -iex "target remote /dev/gdbtty0" -iex "set confirm off" -iex "symbol-file /usr/share/ti/opencl/dsp.out" -iex "add-symbol-file /tmp/openclXmObdu.out 0x86000000" -iex "b exit" -iex "b VectorAdd"

.. Note::
    When debugging with gdbc6x, for an OpenCL NDRangeKernel execution, all
    workgroups are executed on DSP core 0.  While not in debugging mode,
    all available DSP cores participate in the computation.  Similarly, all
    tasks are executed on DSP core 0 when in debugging mode.

.. Note::
    On AM57, if your kernel code contains ``printf``, debugging with gdbc6x
    will crash once ``printf`` is executed.  We are working to fix this issue.

.. Note::
    On AM57, starting with OpenCL product v01.01.08.01, DSPs could enter
    suspended state when idling, to save power.  Sometimes, after a gdbc6x
    debug session, DSP core 0 gets stuck in non-suspendable state.  To resolve
    this, user can either reboot the EVM or use the following script to reload
    DSP firmware.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ cat reload_dspfirmware.sh
        #!/bin/sh
        cd /sys/bus/platform/drivers/omap-rproc
        echo 40800000.dsp > unbind
        echo 41000000.dsp > unbind
        echo 40800000.dsp > bind
        echo 41000000.dsp > bind
