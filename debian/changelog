  * Faster workgroup handling on the dsp
  * The file /var/lock/opencl will now be locked just in time within a process
    at the point when OpenCL is first used. Previously, the lock was created at
    startup of the process, even if OpenCL was not invoked for some time.
  * The OpenCL library creates a host cpu thread to monitor traffic to and from
    the DSP device. Previously that thread would consume a host CPU. It has
    been improved to not consume any CPU resources unless there is an OpenCL
    active kernel on the DSP device. When there is an active kernel on the DSP
    device, it will consume resources at a nice level of 4. This can reduce the
    CPU impact of the monitoring thread. Additionally an environment variable
    TI_OCL_WORKER_SLEEP can be set to a non-negative number that represents the
    number of micro seconds that the monitoring thread should sleep after each
    device check. This will reduce the cpu overhead of the monitor thread but
    will increase the round trip time for any given kernel by the sleep value
    specified plus approximately an additional 70 micro seconds. A value of 100
    microseconds is sufficient to lower the thread overhead to near 0%.
  * Caching of kernel compiles by the OpenCL library are now off by default and
    enabled by the environment variable TI_OCL_KERNEL_CACHE. Previously,
    caching was enabled by default and was disabled by the environment
    variable TI_OCL_CACHE_KERNELS_OFF.
  * Double-precision floating point support is no longer enabled by default in
    the OpenCL library and OpenCL C compiler. It can be re-enabled with the
    environment variable TI_OCL_ENABLE_FP64.  Without double-precision support,
    the TI OpenCL implementation passes all Khronos OpenCL conformance tests
    and will be submitted for acceptance. When double-precision is enabled with
    TI_OCL_ENABLE_FP64, the double-precision builtin functions are not
    conformant to the OpenCL spec. This is primarily due to the spec
    requirement that double-precision operations handle sub-normal values
    properly and the DSP hardware does not support sub-normals. The DSP
    hardware implements flush to zero behavior for subnormals.

  * Add preinst script to check for and remove any existing clc.h.pch file

  * Reduced the CPU load for the OpenCL thread that is created to monitor
    communication traffic to and from the DSP device.  Previously that
    thread would consume 100% of a CPU during the existence of the thread.
    With this modification, the thread will only consume 100% of a CPU while
    the DSP is currently executing kernels.  Otherwise, the thread will consume
    minimal resources.

  * Fix subbuffer alignment check.

  * The environment variable used to enable OpenCL kernel debugging has been
    changed from TI_OCL_DEBUG_KERNEL to TI_OCL_DEBUG.

  * Added host memory allocation functions __malloc_ddr(), __free_ddr(),
    __malloc_msmc(), and __free_msmc().  These functions have the same
    interface as standard malloc/free but manages memory from
    host+dsp shareable memory.  These can be used within the host application.

  * Added dsp memory allocation functions __malloc_ddr(), __free_ddr(),
    __malloc_msmc(), __free_msmc(), __malloc_l2(), and __free_l2().
    These functions are available from dsp kernel code to manage memory from
    the dsp heaps.

    The OpenCL example 'dspheap' has been added to illustrate how the dsp
    heap memory can be allocated and managed between kernel invocations.

  * Significantly improved OpenCL performance on cache coherency operations
    for buffer sizes of 4MB and above.

  * The async_workgroup_copy and async_workgroup_strided_copy functions are
    now implemented to use EDMA channels when available.

  * The number/size of Kernel arguments are now fully compliant with the
    OpenCL 1.1 spec. Up to 1024 bytes of arguments are supported and vector
    types can be passed as standalone arguments.

  * On the dsp, the standard malloc() function will now allocate from an
    8M pool of DDR.

  * The OpenCL package version number can now be obtained by either invoking
    'clocl --version' or making a standard OpenCL platform query.  The OpenCL
    'platform' example illustrates how to make an OpenCL platform query.

  * Setting the environment variable TI_OCL_CGT_INSTALL is not required if
    the C6000 compiler runtime library and header files are located in
    the ppa package default install path.  TI_OCL_CGT_INSTALL can still be
    used to specify an alternate search path.
