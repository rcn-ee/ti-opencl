         * This function implements a big part of what is described in
         * \ref events .
         *
         * It is called by \c Coal::Event::setStatus() when an event is
         * completed, or by \c queueEvent(). Its purpose is to explore the list
         * of queued events (\c p_events) and to call
         * \c Coal::DeviceInterface::pushEvent() for each event meeting its push
         * conditions.
         *
         * \param ready_event is know to be pushable, push events in the
         * queue till this point, skip the events after this one.
         *
         * \param one_event_completed_on_device can be used to differentiate
         * whether this function is called by worker thread when an event is
         * completed, or by main thread's queueEvent().
         *
         * \section conditions Conditions
         *
         * If the command queue has the \c CL_OUT_OF_ORDER_EXEC_MODE_ENABLE
         * property disabled, an event can be pushed only if all the previous
         * ones in the list are completed with success. This way, an event
         * must be completed before any other can be pushed. This ensures
         * in-order execution.
         *
         * If this property is enable, more complex heuristics are used.
         *
         * The event list \c p_events is explored from top to bottom. At each
         * loop iteration, checks are performed to see if the event can be pushed.
         *
         * - When a \c Coal::BarrierEvent is encountered, no more events can be
         *   pushed, except if the \c Coal::BarrierEvent is the first in the list,
         *   as that means there are no other events that can be pushed, so the
         *   barrier can go away
         * - All events that are already pushed or finished are skipped
         * - The wait list of the event is then explored to ensure that all its
         *   dependencies are met.
         * - Finally, if the events passes all the tests, it is either pushed on
         *   the device, or simply set to \c Coal::Event::Complete if it's a
         *   dummy event (see \c Coal::Event::isInstantaneous()).
